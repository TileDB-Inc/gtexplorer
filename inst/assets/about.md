Explore RNA-seq data generated by the [Genotype-Tissue Expression](https://www.gtexportal.org) (GTEx) project. Enter a gene of interest and hit *Search* to retrieve its expression values across all 17,384 samples from TileDB. You can select a particular transcript from the results table.

#### Data

- GTEx version: 8
- GENCODE version: 26
- Raw data: [GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_tpm.gct.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v8/rna_seq_data/GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_tpm.gct.gz)
- TileDB Array: [gtex-rnaseq-gene-tpms](https://cloud.tiledb.com/arrays/details/aaronwolen/gtex-rnaseq-gene-tpms/overview)

Gene-level TPM values for single transcript-models generated for each gene and across all samples/tissues were ingested into a sparse TileDB array stored on AWS S3.
